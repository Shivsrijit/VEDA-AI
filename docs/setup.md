# Local Development Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the VedaAI Assessment Creator on your local machine from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system before proceeding:
1. **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher is required.
2. **npm**: Usually bundled with Node.js.
3. **MongoDB**: A running local instance (mongodb://localhost:27017) or a remote MongoDB Atlas connection URI.
4. **Redis** (Optional but recommended): A running local Redis instance (redis://127.0.0.1:6379) to power the production background job queue. If Redis is not available, the backend will automatically and gracefully fall back to an **In Memory Asynchronous Queue** so that you can still generate assignments smoothly.

## Step by Step Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd "VEDA AI"
```

### Step 2: Configure the Backend

1. Navigate into the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Create an environment configuration file named `.env` in the root of the `backend/` folder:
    ```env
    PORT=5001
    WS_PORT=5002
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-mongodb-uri-here
    REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your-actual-gemini-key
    ```
    
    > **Note**: Make sure to replace `MONGODB_URI` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Google Gemini developer key. If you do not have a Gemini API key yet, you can obtain one from the Google AI Studio.

4. Start the backend in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The console will log startup confirmations, including the HTTP port (5001), the WebSocket port (5002), database connection status, and whether it connected to Redis or fell back to the local in memory queue.

### Step 3: Configure the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```
    You will see the fully interactive VedaAI dashboard loading seamlessly.

## Building for Production

If you are deploying VedaAI to a production environment, follow these build steps:

### Build Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
# Starts the compiled JavaScript server from the dist/ folder
npm start
```

### Build Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Starts the production Next.js server
npm run start
```

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Q1: The backend says "Redis server not detected. Fallback: Running an in memory queue." Is this an error?
**No.** This is a built-in resiliency feature. We designed the backend to detect if Redis is offline. If so, it boots up an in memory scheduler that executes the exact same Gemini AI pipelines asynchronously. You do not need to install Redis to test the application locally.

### Q2: I clicked "Download as PDF" and nothing happened.
Make sure the backend is running. The frontend does not compile PDFs locally; it fetches them on the fly from the backend at your API assignments download endpoint. Also, check your browser permissions. The application uses the FileSystem Write API to let you choose where to save the file. If your browser does not support this, it will fall back to a standard anchor download.

### Q3: How do I toggle Dark Mode?
Click on **Settings** in the sidebar, type in your school name/avatar preferences if desired, and toggle the theme switch. The dark theme is written entirely in Vanilla CSS and applies immediately across all views.
